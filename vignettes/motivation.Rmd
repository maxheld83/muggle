## Abstract

Between GUI-based reports and scripted data science lies an unproductive valley that combines the worst of both worlds:
poor scaleability and high overhead.
To avoid getting stuck there, small and medium-sized teams must build strategic data products (not one-off scripts) and concentrate on business value (not infrastructure).

{muggle}'s opininated DevOps help with this transition.
It standardises the compute environment in development, testing and deployment on a multi-stage `Dockerfile` with `ONBUILD` triggers for lightweight target images and leverages public cloud services (RSPM, GitHub Actions, GitHub Packages).
In contrast to some existing approaches, {muggle} never infers developer intent and has a minimal git footprint.
