## Citations

### Citing Others

To cite other works, rely on the default helper program [citeproc](https://github.com/jgm/citeproc) which is used in pandoc, and, in turn by many rmarkdown formats, including pkgdown vignettes.
If you rely on academic citation, you might want to *only* render to rmarkdown output formats which use pandoc, and therefore citeproc, under the hood.

Using citeproc inside rmarkdown documents is documented [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html) and [https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/citations.html].

Your `*.bib` (or `*.json`) files should be `git commit`ted with the rest of your code.
To keep `git diff`s informative, you should only commit entries which you are actually citing -- don't commit your *entire* library.

The path passed to the YAML frontmatter field `bibliography: ` should be relative from the directory where you are running `rmarkdown::render()` (and friends).
In a pkgdown vignette or article, this will be `vignettes/`.

Committing the `*.bib` file is arguably in violation of the muggle dictum to avoid derivative files:
your intent is to *cite*, say [`Fenner_2012`](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat3283), not the pages, journal, or other metadata of that article.
Given a [DOI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier), all additional metadata are superfluous.
DOIs are, however, not very human readable, and we thus need a dictionary that maps our (human-readable, local) citekeys (`Fenner_2012`) to its metadata -- that's your `*.bib`.
If you're adventurous and have a great memory for DOIs, check out [knitcitations](https://github.com/cboettig/knitcitations) or [pandoc-url2cite](https://github.com/phiresky/pandoc-url2cite) both of which actually let you use DOIs directly in intext citations.


#### Zotero

The [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) is a frequently used open-source reference manager.
As many programs, it can export the required `*.bib` files, but there are some *gotchas* to consider.

Zotero does *not* natively store the citekeys (say, `Newton_1728`) on which citeproc relies.
Instead, out of the box, Zotero will generate these citekeys anew on every export.
As such, the citekeys can change between exports, depending on the software version and settings as well as the underlying data.

It should be noted that while frustrating, this behavior makes sense in principle:
citekeys are merely an arbitrary user interface for plain-text editing.
They are not proper resource identifiers, such as DOI.

Unfortunately, if you are collaborating with others (or future selves), changing citekeys can cause major problems:
You'll suddenly have missing bibliography entries, and may have to hunt through your source, replacing the citekeys.

The [better bibtex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) plugin for Zotero fixes this problem, along with offering other features and conveniences.
It [generates citekeys](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/citing/) for you, and, crucially, allows you to *pin* these citekeys, i.e. it lets you store *once*-generated citekeys inside your Zotero database (as additional metadata).
This ensures that citekeys stay the same.

To store such static citekeys in your Zotero database, select your new or yet-unpinned citations in Zotero and click "Pin BibTeX key":

```{r pin, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Pinning Citekeys"}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "communicating/pin.png")
```

better bibtex also allows you to *automatically* update an exported `*.bib` when Zotero detects changes.
This can be very convenient, and will even usually create tight `git diff`s.
