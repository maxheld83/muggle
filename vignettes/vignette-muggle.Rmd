By default, pkgdown builds vignettes (or rather, articles) using a special format based on `rmarkdown::html_document()`.
This format does not include the automatic numbering and crossreferencing of figures, tables, equations, and (for cross-references) sections supported by [bookdown](http://bookdown.org).
The [`bookdown::html_document2()`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/a-single-document.html) render function backports these features for uses outside of bookdown.

This vignettes documents how you can use `bookdown::html_document2()` and tests its compatibility with the subugoetheme against the default.
